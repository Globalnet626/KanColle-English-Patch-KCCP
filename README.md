Translated textures to be used by the assets modifier of KCCacheProxy.

Use at your own risk, make sure to clear your cache when updating.
Unlike the POI method, the assets don't break when updates happen in the game.
No bans as the API is never touched.

Instructions:
Download the master and extract it anywhere, then use KCCP to add the mod.
